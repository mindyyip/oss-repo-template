## 2. Reading Assignment

The 10 criteria of Open Source Definision are important because they allow developers to understand how open source can be used. For example, it is important that any projects must include source code. Also, a lot of the critera has to do with the license and what rules it must follow for it to be used legally.For example, almost half of the criteria deals with the license and how it must be technology-neutral, must not restrict other software, must not be specific to a product, and much more. It is interesting to see how many rules there are and the strictness of all them to ensure that developers are not doing anything illegal.

In addition to the article on Smart Questions, another thing that could be done is looking through current forums that relate to your question and direct messaging or emailing the user who either posted the question and see if they came up with a solution or what they tried doing that may or may not have worked or messaging someone who answered it for more details. Another suggestion is making sure your header is not too general but also not too specific. Sometimes, the error that you have might be too specific to your machine that no useful search results will come up, so it might be helpful to make it less specific so that a related issue can come up as well.

In Chapter 3 of Free Culture, the first thing that I got out of this was that there was such a huge lawsuit against someone who did not even know he was doing anything wrong. Not only that, but the fact that this was about a student at RPI made it even more intriguing to read about. The severity of the situation and the price Jesse had to pay helped me become more aware of what could potentially happen if I were to not follow one of the rules. This chapter allowed me to understand that I should ensure that I'm following the right steps when using open source software. Also, before this article, I was not fully aware of what could happen, like how Jesse received a lawsuit against the RIAA, which was something I did not even know existed. Overall, it was interesting to read about the details of the lawsuit that happened to Jesse and the other students that were sued. The article also brought up a good point when they asked where is the morality in taking money from a student who doesn't have much money compared to the RIAA. Nevertheless, while the lawsuit seemed extreme to me, it was understandable that Jesse did not do everything correctly and should have been more cautious in his work.

## 6. Reflection

Tensorflow is an open source project that seems interesting to evaluate since it is used for machine learning. A common problem are games like chess, soduku, or other logic games can sometimes be challenging for me, and I think that tensorflow can help with that. Tensorflow can be used to understand the game board or grid and process it using image recognition and coming up with ways to create a solution. Through deep learning, tensorflow can be used to train an AI to develop strategies and understand different ways to move pieces or input numbers to win while following all of the rules. In order to do this, a dataset must be used for most games that set up the board and develop the rules and instructions. Tensorflow can be used to train the machine through different methods, like positive reinforcement or other machine learning strategies.
